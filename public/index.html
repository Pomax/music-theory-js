                Hook up a MIDI controller and see if the "led" turns green. If it does:
                you're good to go, go start playing and slide some draw bars! Tweak some
                knobs, see what happens! Note that this works in Chrome, but not "out of
                the box" in Firefox, mostly because Firefox has been spending the last
                six years writing comments instead of just implementing the core for
                Web MIDI so you need a plugin. I know, right? Crazy, but <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/">easy
                enought to add</a> (note that it links to 2 more things you'll need
                installed. I thought that was worth it. Maybe you don't. Use Chrome
                if you think addons are too much work).

                Think this is cool? <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax">Shoot me an opinion!</a>.
                For the code, have a look <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/music-theory-js/">here</a>,
                but for the moment it's on a "look but don't take" basis. I'm still trying to get to
                a v0.1-pre-alpha at the moment.
