                Hook up a MIDI controller and see if the "led" turns green. If it does:
                you're good to go, go start playing and slide some sliders and tweak some
                knobs on your controller, see what happens! Note that this works in
                Chrome, but not "out of the box" in Firefox, mostly because Firefox
                has been spending the last six years writing comments instead of just
                implementing the core for Web MIDI so you need a plugin. I know, right?
                Crazy, but <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/">easy
                enought to add</a> (note that it links to 2 more things you'll need
                installed. I thought that was worth it. Maybe you don't. Use Chrome
                if you think addons are too much work).

                Think this is cool? <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax">Shoot me an opinion!</a>.
                For the code, have a look <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/music-theory-js/">here</a>,
                but for the moment it's on a "look but don't take" basis. I'm still trying to get to
                a v0.1-pre-alpha at the moment.
