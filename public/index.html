                Hook up a MIDI controller and see if the "led" turns green. If it does:
                you're good to go, go start playing and slide some sliders and tweak some
                knobs on your controller, see what happens! Don't see anything happen? Click
                on a slider's label to "CC learn" a different controller, just like you would
                in any regular old VST instrument, and see what happens, v2!

                Note that this works out of the box in Chrome, but not in Firefox, mostly
                because Firefox  is still in the process of figuring out their implementation
                approach for Web MIDI. It's been six years, but no one's paid them to implement
                it, so... you get what you pay for? Thankfully, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/">the
                web midi extension for Firefox</a> lets you add Web MIDI support pretty easily,
                although it does need 2 more things installed. I thought that was worth it.
                Maybe you don't. Use Chrome if you think addons are too much work.

                Think this is cool? <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax">Shoot me an opinion!</a>.
                For the code, have a look <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/music-theory-js/">here</a>,
                but for the moment it's on an "all rights reserved while I get this codebase to something
                resembling a v0.1-pre-alpha" license.
