# Music Theory .JS

For when you want to do music things, using music theory, rather than just pressing some keys on a piano.

There's a live demo up on https://pomax.github.io/music-theory-js/public/ but the controller mappings might be wrong because I'm testing this with an Arturia MiniLab and its uses a CC mapping that might not apply to your controller.

Don't worry, I _am_ adding "Q learning" to this demonstrator because it's much easier to just say "k, change a controll and I'll use that thing's code" than it is to write mappings for every single MIDI device out there.

Let's just make music?
